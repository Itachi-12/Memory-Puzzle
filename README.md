# Memory-Puzzle
its a basic memory puzzle game written in c++.
This program creates a 4x4 grid of random numbers, 
shuffles the numbers in the grid, and then allows the user to enter coordinates of two numbers to check if they match. 
If a match is found, the number of matches is incremented.
The game ends when all matches have been found.
